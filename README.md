The main goal in this challede is to get familiar with using git as a collaborative tool. 
We will adding features to existing minigames: snake and pacman retrieved from http://www.grantkenks.com/docs/freegames/index.html

To run this code, the freegames modules is requiered.

We will be adding the following features to the code:
	*Pacman:
		- Ghosts will become faster
		- The map layout will be changed
		- The ghosts' behaviour will be changed, in order for them to make better decisions
	*Snake:
		- At the beginning of the game, a random color, from five different possibilities, will be assigned to the snake and to the food. These colors will be different from each other.
		- The food will randomly move throughout the game, making it harder for the snake to eat it.
